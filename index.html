Understand the patterns and logic behind the beautiful world of music.</h2>

<p>It's hard to find someone who doesn't love music. In a world full of discordance and disharmony, everyone agrees that music basically rocks. But few of us know the why or the how or the what of music: why certain songs sound inherently sad, how singers and musicians find a harmony or improvise in a jam session, what makes jazz or reggae or classical music sound so distinctly like jazz or reggae or classical.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking Musically</strong> is the book that shows you how music "works," without tying you up in formal musical training. Using clear, everyday language and simple analogies, this book will teach you the secrets of things like keys, chords, scales and harmonies; the distinctive features of different genres; and the mathematical patterns that determine everything from the spacing of piano keys to the thickness of guitar strings.</p>
